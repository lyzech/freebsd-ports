The CuraEngine is a C++ console application for 3D printing GCode generation.
It has been made as a better and faster alternative to the old Skeinforge
engine.

The CuraEngine is pure C++ and uses Clipper. Furthermore it depends on
libArcus by Ultimaker.

This is just a console application for GCode generation. For a full graphical
application look at Cura which is the graphical frontend for CuraEngine.
